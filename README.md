# KayakLaun.ch
KayakLaun.ch is a pet project of mine I started to address a challenge from my hobby of sea kayaking; finding places to launch and land a sea kayak with the required facilities nearby. So, I created KayakLaun.ch to share a map I maintain of this information and details of paddle routes with fellow sea kayakers.

KayakLaun.ch is a responsive, [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)-based static website which makes heavy use of Google Maps APIs to enable visitors to browse and search custom, multi-layered datasets.
