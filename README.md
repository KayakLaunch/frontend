# kayaklaun.ch
KayakLaun.ch is a pet project of mine I started to address a challenge from my hobby of sea kayaking. Finding places to launch and land a sea kayak with the required facilities nearby can be difficult. So, I created KayakLaun.ch to share a map I maintain of this information with fellow sea kayakers.

KayakLaun.ch is a responsive, Bootstrap-based single page website which makes heavy use of Google Maps APIs to enable visitors to browse and search a custom, multi-layered dataset.
